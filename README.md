# Getting And Cleaning Data Project
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio and Luca Oneto.

The R script "run_analysis.R" performs the following tasks:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find additional detail on the transformation process in the CodeBook.md file.
